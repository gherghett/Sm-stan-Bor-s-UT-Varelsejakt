you can now register and login but not log out, using email and password. oauth does not work with expo, but shuold work with a native build however i have not tried it even though we have the code in the project

next steps are making pages that require authentication that shows user settings and stuff like that.

might be worth mkaing a guestnly auth component to mirror the pattern of the user only, right now the signup and signin pages handle sign in users which is messy
